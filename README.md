# Range-of-ESPNOW
We tested the reliability of ESP-NOW by having NodeMCU A transmit 100 packets per second, each containing 250 bytes of data, to NodeMCU B which acted as the receiver. NodeMCU B counted the packets received and printed the count every second. This allowed us to evaluate the communication performance of the ESP-NOW protocol.
